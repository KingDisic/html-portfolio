<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jesse Petersen and I'm a Web Developer.
  I love music and playing games.That sounds average I know right!
  But I realised while playing my games that I wanted to become a Web Developer.
  Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
  So while playing my games I thought what could make these games better
  and it killed me that I could not figure it out.I then found a course and up until today I still enjoy it.
  But I'm just another ordinary person who loves cars and enjoying coding as much as I enjoy socializing.

  So my motto is "stay true to yourself because trying to please everybody causes more damage within yourself"
